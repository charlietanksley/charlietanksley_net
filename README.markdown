A Middleman powered site (with blog) at 
[charlietanksley.net](http://www.charlietanksley.net). 

This site is deployed with 
[whiskey_disk](https://github.com/flogic/whiskey_disk).  To deploy 
simply `$ wd deploy --to=production`.  (I'm going to see if there is a 
shortcut for that, but that works for the time being).
